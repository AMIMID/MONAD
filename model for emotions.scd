///the 6d spherical model contains three axis based on positive and negative aspects of emotional being through major and minor components for the x,y axis and high/low energy overtine/undetone lamdoma components for the z axis. So in essence it is sort of high/low energy pleasent/unpleasent real/imaginary complex axis for emotions. Therefore the model has 8 basic emotions as the are the complex axial vertices of the spheric model. The model could also have in a deeper level of 6 basic emotions based on the axis zeniths representing emotional status for the forementioned properties of the axis.
///So calibrating the synthesis algorithm to produce a relative basic emotion sound instance would mean to set the tone and scalar scales as major or minor and the lamdoma multiplier as overtones or undertones.(Note that the z axis argument, in contrast to major and minor has further scaling of energy other than the bipolar chategorization overtone/undertone, but this can be conceptually justified as a form of oscillation as the z axis is the initial status of the spherical model as multidimensional).
///Further chategorization of the sounds to branches of the basic emotions set coule be set by the different nuancies of the oscillator modules (acoustic sounds used for the bpf oscillator, other lelectronic instruments as oscillators, transducers, reverbs, etc.)
///As all these chategorized sounds and instances of the algorithm and the instrumentations are instances of the spherical model and its rhizomes, there are also the nodes that connect these different instances and work as a selection interface.(further info on sequencer file).


// in the case of non musical scale, rounded tone tonal model, but in the case of a spheric harmony unrounded one, then the one axis of the emotions model that was in the bipolar scheme between minor and major will just be another high/low energy lamdoma model with the correspondent overtone or undertone multiplier to the tone (not the fundamental this time). Like so the two basic axis become a lamdoma complex while the third z,4d oscillation axis becomes a minor/major system, and not vice versa. Thus conceptually for the composition we can say that a tuned system according to classical music harmonies with scaling and grouping of tones oscillates in the lomdoma domain through time, while a sphere harmony float 12-tone system with no scaling fluxuates between a minor and a major mode through time, and that can be seen as the inherit adverasrial presence of tonality (look at sequencer file and music file).
//And if the fundamental scalar is also unrounded then there is no minor/major scale choice, rather a lamdoma for the tones, a lamdoma for the fundamental,and another lamdoma as multiplier.
